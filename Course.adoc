* Use mathematical language for precision
* Mathematics only takes care of a small part! (Also: political science, sociology, psychology, economics‚Ä¶)
* A rigorous introduction to some fundamental constructs of mathematics

Examples

* Measure pollution
* Organize society so as to maximize global utility
* Distribute resources fairly
* Reduce inequality
* Satisfy citizen‚Äôs preferences

== Relations and properties of relations
=== Definition and some properties
* Binary relation on stem:[A]: subset of stem:[A √ó A]

* Relations between objects and persons
* Notation: stem:[a R b] means stem:[(a, b) ‚àà R]

Directed graph

==== Properties of relations
In this document, properties of a relation stem:[R] are expressed with implicit qualifiers: a non bound letter stem:[x] is implicitly prefixed with stem:[‚àÄx ‚àà ‚Ñ±(R)]

==== Transitivity
Transitive relation: stem:[a R b R c ‚áí a R c]

* Transire, to pass to the other side, convey an action
* I push my car VS I sleep in my car: push used transitively
* Relates a to c through b

==== Reflexivity
stem:[a R a]

==== Irreflexivity
stem:[¬¨(a R a)]

A relation that is not reflexive is not necessarily irreflexive (similarly for other properties).

==== Preorder
* Transitive and reflexive
* (Also called: partial preorder, quasi order)

Here: mostly transitive and reflexive relations

Hasse diagram: stem:[a R b, a ‚â† b], corresponds to a line descending from a to b.

==== Symmetry
stem:[a R b ‚áí b R a]

==== Asymmetry
stem:[a R b ‚áí ¬¨(b R a)]

==== Antisymmetry
stem:[a ‚â† b ‚àß a R b ‚áí ¬¨(b R a)]

==== Exercices
See https://oliviercailloux.github.io/Introduction-to-measurement-theory/Ex1.html[Exercices S1].

=== A zoo of relations
==== Equivalence
An equivalence relation is a transitive, (reflexive and) symmetric relation.

Each element in an equivalence relation has an associated equivalence class. The set of equivalence classes, called the quotient by stem:[R], is denoted by stem:[‚Ñ±(R) // R]. It partitions (disjointly covers) stem:[‚Ñ±(R)].

* Symmetric part of a relation stem:[R]: stem:[sym(R) = {(a, a) ‚àà R}]
* The symmetric part of a preorder stem:[R] is an equivalence relation
* Intuitively speaking, a preorder defines equivalence classes (namely, its quotient by stem:[sym(R)]) and orders them (possibly partially)
* That ordering is a relation on its quotient by stem:[sym(R)] and is called the reduction of a preorder stem:[R]
* Formally, the reduction of stem:[R] is defined as stem:[{(a^***, b^***) ‚àà (‚Ñ±(R) // sym(R))¬≤ | ‚àÉ a ‚àà a^***, b ‚àà b^*** | a R b}].

// stem:[{a ‚àà A | ‚àÉx ‚àà X | x < a}]

// === Converse
// Optional

// === Negative transitivity
// Optional

==== Side-uniqueness, ontoness
* Right-unique: stem:[a R b ‚àß a R c ‚áí b = c]
* A right-unique relation is a function from stem:[ùíü(R)] to stem:[ùìò(R)]; we can write stem:[R(a)] to denote the single stem:[b ‚àà ùìò(R)] such that stem:[a R b].
* Onto stem:[Y] (right-total over stem:[Y]): stem:[Y = ùìò(R)]
* Left-unique (injective): stem:[b R a ‚àß c R a ‚áí b = c]

==== Weak completeness
stem:[a ‚â† b ‚áí a R b ‚à® b R a]

==== Order
* Transitive, reflexive, antisymmetric
* (Also called: partial order)

Intuitively: a (possibly partial) ranking without ties

==== Complete preorder
* Transitive, reflexive, weakly complete
* (Often called: weak order)

* Intuitively: a ranking with ties
* The symmetric part of a complete preorder is an equivalence relation
* A complete preorder defines equivalence classes and orders them completely

==== Complete order
* Transitive, reflexive, weakly complete, antisymmetric
* (Also called: simple order, linear order, total order)

Intuitively: a ranking without ties

The reduction of a complete preorder stem:[R] is a complete order on stem:[‚Ñ±(R) // sym(R)].

// === Strict order
// Transitive and irreflexive
// (Often called: strict partial order)

==== Generalisation to binary operations
* A relation from stem:[X] to stem:[Y] is a subset of stem:[X √ó Y]. It is non homogeneous when stem:[X ‚â† Y].
* A binary operation stem:[Œ±] on stem:[A] is a right-unique relation from stem:[A √ó A] to stem:[A] whose domain is stem:[(A √ó A)].
* It can be viewed as a function from stem:[A √ó A] to stem:[A]; we can write stem:[a Œ± b] to denote the single stem:[c ‚àà ùìò(Œ±)] such that stem:[(a, b) Œ± c].
* Examples: stem:[+], stem:[√ó] on stem:[‚Ñï].

==== Note about terminology
For many authors (excluding Halmos but including Roberts), the set on which stem:[R] is defined is exogenous, thus a relation is a pair stem:[(A, R)] with stem:[R ‚äÜ A¬≤] (hence stem:[‚Ñ±(R) ‚äÜ A]). This allows for the possibility that stem:[‚Ñ±(R) ‚â† A]. Weak completeness is then defined as stem:[‚àÄ a ‚â† b ‚àà A: a R b ŒΩ b R a]. Similarly, other definitions (such as reflexivity) then differ from those given here. In this document, we assume stem:[A] is chosen equal to stem:[‚Ñ±(R)], in which case the definitions coincide.

==== Exercices
See https://oliviercailloux.github.io/Introduction-to-measurement-theory/Ex2.html[Exercices S2].

== Fundamental measurement
* We want to assign numbers to reflect some properties of some systems.
* Given relation stem:[R] ‚Äúlooks shorter than‚Äù on stem:[A = {a, b, ‚Ä¶}], can we assign numbers stem:[f(a)] so that stem:[f(a) < f(b) ‚áî a R b]?
* Similarly for relations ‚Äúpreferred to‚Äù, ‚Äúday with better air quality‚Äù.

* We might also want to reflect operations such as ‚Äúcombining‚Äù: consider ‚Äúis lighter‚Äù, with A including combined objects; can we then assign numbers stem:[f(.)] so that when stem:[a] and stem:[b] combined are lighter than stem:[c], stem:[f(a) + f(b) < f(c)]; or so that when stem:[c] denotes the combination of stem:[a] and stem:[b], stem:[f(a) + f(b) = f(c)]?
* Similarly for relation ‚Äúpreferred to‚Äù on sets of objects.

* Relation stem:[R] on stem:[A] corresponds to relation stem:[T] on stem:[‚Ñù] through function stem:[f] from stem:[A] to stem:[‚Ñù]: stem:[a R b ‚áî f(a) T f(b)].
* (If stem:[T] is restricted to the image of stem:[f], it is determined uniquely by stem:[f] and stem:[R], in other words, stem:[R] never corresponds to two relations stem:[T1 ‚â† T2] through a single function stem:[f] when stem:[‚Ñ±(T1) = ‚Ñ±(T2) = ùìò(f)]. Proof: if R corresponds to T1 and T2 through f with ‚Ñ±(T1) = ‚Ñ±(T2) = ùìò(f), then x T1 y iff a R b, for any a ‚àà f-1(x), b ‚àà f-1(y), iff x * T2 y thus T1 = T2.)
* Operation stem:[‚äô] on stem:[A] corresponds to operation stem:[Œ±] on stem:[‚Ñù] through function stem:[f] from stem:[A] to stem:[‚Ñù]: stem:[f(a ‚äô b) = f(a) Œ± f(b)].
* stem:[R] is homomorphic to stem:[T] iff it corresponds to stem:[T] through some function stem:[f].
* stem:[(R, ‚äô)] is homomorphic to stem:[(T, Œ±)] iff stem:[R] corresponds to stem:[T] and stem:[‚äô] to stem:[Œ±] through the same function stem:[f].
* More generally, stem:[(R, {‚äô_i})] is homomorphic to stem:[(T, {Œ±_i})] iff stem:[R] corresponds to stem:[T] through some function stem:[f] and each stem:[‚äô_i] corresponds to stem:[Œ±_i] through stem:[f].
* The tuple stem:[(f, (T, {Œ±_i}))] is called a measurement scale for stem:[(R, {‚äô_i})].
// (If f is a scale, 
// ‚àÄx, y ‚àà ùìò(f): f-1(x) √ó f-1(y) ‚äÜ R ŒΩ f-1(x) √ó f-1(y) ‚à© R = ‚àÖ 
// and
// f(f-1(x) o f-1(y)) is a singleton.)

=== Representation theorem
* A theorem of the form: under such conditions on stem:[(R, {‚äô_i})], the system is homomorphic to stem:[(T, {Œ±_i})].
* Constructive proof: gives a procedure to build a scale stem:[f].
* Intuitively: transitivity of stem:[R] is required for homomorphism to stem:[‚â•].

Uniqueness: to determine properties of the numbers that transfer to our observations.

=== Homomorphisms and scale types
* Number of persons VS height of a person
* Ratio of weight VS ratio of t¬∞

Given stem:[(R, {‚äô_i})] corresponding to stem:[(T, {Œ±_i})] through stem:[f], admissible transformation stem:[œÜ] from stem:[f(A)] to stem:[‚Ñù] (thus stem:[œÜ ‚àò f] from stem:[A] to stem:[‚Ñù]): stem:[(R, {‚äô_i})] corresponds to stem:[(T, {Œ±_i})] through stem:[œÜ ‚àò f].

// R has a regular homomorphism to T: it has a homomorphism to T and for every scales (f, (T, {Œ±_i})), (g, (T, {Œ±_i})), for some œÜ, g = œÜ ‚àò f.
stem:[R] has a regular homomorphism to stem:[T]: it has a homomorphism to stem:[T] and for every scales stem:[(f, (T, {Œ±_i}))], stem:[(g, (T, {Œ±_i}))], stem:[f(a) = f(b) ‚áî g(a) = g(b)].

Scale type depends on the class of admissible transformations œÜ.

* Absolute: œÜ(x) = x; Counting
* Ratio: œÜ(x) = rx with r > 0; Mass
* Interval: œÜ(x) = rx + s with r > 0; T¬∞ without absolute zero
* Ordinal: strictly monotone increasing transformation; Ordinal preference, Mohs scale of hardness
* Nominal: any bijection; Labels

// Example using air pollution might be interesting but is not hugely convincing concerning meaningfulness.

== Representation of complete preorders
=== Arithmetic and infinite sets
* Successor of stem:[s]: stem:[s ‚ãÉ {s}]
* Axiom of infinity: ‚àÉ successor set A
* ‚Ñï: intersection of all successor sets in A
* Permits induction, which we use to define addition of zero, then addition of one, ‚Ä¶
* Finite set: bijection with an element of ‚Ñï

=== The ‚â• relation
* If R is a complete preorder and ‚Ñ±(R) is finite, it is homomorphic to ‚â•.
* Necessary and sufficient conditions.
* Can we relax finiteness?

Scale type: ordinal

== When indifference is not transitive
=== Requirement of transitivity
* R homomorphic to ‚â• requires transitivity.
* Define I as the symmetric part of R.
* R homomorphic to ‚â• requires I to be transitive.

=== Examples
Detection threshold

* Coffee with sugar
* Noise level

Incomparability

* Pony VS bicycle (https://doi.org/10.2307/2224802[Armstrong, 1939])
* Good job VS apartment
* Reform social security: better for end-of-life VS better life expectancy

=== Representation
* x ‚â•Œ¥ y: x ‚â• y - Œ¥
* Constant threshold Œ¥

Won‚Äôt do for incomparability: Pony* ‚âª Pony, Bicycle ‚âΩ Pony*, Bicycle* ‚âª Bicycle but Pony ‚âΩ Bicycle*.

=== Completed semiorder
‚âΩ is a completed semiorder: weakly complete and reflexive and satisfies

* S2: a ‚âΩ b ‚àß c ‚âΩ d ‚áí c ‚âΩ b ‚à® a ‚âΩ d
* S3: a ‚âΩ b ‚âΩ c ‚áí a ‚âΩ d ‚à® d ‚âΩ c

Covers: a W c iff (d ‚âΩ a ‚áí d ‚âΩ c) ‚àß (c ‚âΩ d ‚áí a ‚âΩ d).

* S2 and S3 are together equivalent to ‚àÄa ‚âª b ‚âΩ c: a W c.
* S2 and S3 are together equivalent to ‚àÄa ‚âΩ b ‚âª c: a W c.

Equivalently:

* S2 can be written ¬¨(a ‚âΩ b ‚âª c ‚âΩ d ‚âª a) and S3 can be written ¬¨(c ‚âª d ‚âª a ‚âΩ b ‚âΩ c), writing x ‚âª y iff ¬¨(y ‚âΩ x).
* S2 can be written ¬¨(d ‚âΩ a ‚âª b ‚âΩ c ‚âª d) and S3 can be written ¬¨(d ‚âª a ‚âª b ‚âΩ c ‚âΩ d).
* S2 can be written ‚àÄa ‚âª b ‚âΩ c: (d ‚âΩ a ‚áí d ‚âΩ c) and S3 can be written ‚àÄa ‚âª b ‚âΩ c: (c ‚âΩ d ‚áí a ‚âΩ d).
* S2 can be written ¬¨(c ‚âª d ‚âΩ a ‚âª b ‚âΩ c) and S3 can be written ¬¨(b ‚âΩ c ‚âΩ d ‚âª a ‚âª b).
* Renaming, S2 can be written ¬¨(d ‚âª a ‚âΩ b ‚âª c ‚âΩ d) and S3 can be written ¬¨(d ‚âΩ a ‚âΩ b ‚âª c ‚âª d).
* Thus, S2 can be written ‚àÄa ‚âΩ b ‚âª c: (c ‚âΩ d ‚áí a ‚âΩ d) and S3 can be written ‚àÄa ‚âΩ b ‚âª c: (d ‚âΩ a ‚áí d ‚âΩ c).
* By contrapositive, using these two equivalences, ¬¨(a W c) ‚áí ‚àÄb: (b ‚âΩ c ‚áí b ‚âΩ a) ‚àß (a ‚âΩ b ‚áí c ‚âΩ b), in other words, ¬¨(a W c) ‚áí c W a.

If ‚âΩ is a completed semiorder, then W is a complete preorder.
Proof. Transitive: If c ‚âΩ d then by b W c ‚âΩ d we get b ‚âΩ d and by a W b ‚âΩ d we get a ‚âΩ d. It is strongly complete, as seen just above.

If ‚âΩ is a completed semiorder, then c W b ‚áí c ‚âΩ b (and b ‚âª c ‚áí b W c).
Proof. c W b ‚áí (c ‚âΩ c ‚áí c ‚âΩ b) ‚áí c ‚âΩ b (and use contrapositive and completeness of W).

Thm. If ‚âΩ is a completed semiorder, then a W b W c ~ a ‚áí a ~ b ~ c, writing x ~ y iff x ‚âΩ y ‚âΩ x.
Pr. Rewrite the hypothesis as c ‚âΩ a W b W c ‚âΩ a and obtain c ‚âΩ b ‚âΩ a by definition of W and a ‚âΩ b ‚âΩ c using W ‚äÜ ‚âΩ.

=== Representation theorem
If ‚âΩ is a completed semiorder, then there exists a function f from ‚Ñ±(‚âΩ) to ‚Ñù such that stem:[f(a) ‚â•_1 f(b) ‚áî a ‚âΩ b].
